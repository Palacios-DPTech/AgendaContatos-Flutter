<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
   This project was challenging for me because  is a little more complex, I learned and also reinforced many previous lessons.
   I used new widgets, resources and this example of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), made me learn a lot, it will certainly be a learning experience that I will take        with me in all the technologies that I will learn.
   In this project I also used the SQLite database, with the Flutter plugin, the sqflite, which will help insert, query, update and delete queries. <br>
